## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **PyPI install clarity and release gating.** Documented `pipx --python python3.13`
  for environments where unsupported Python wheel tags cause older-version
  resolution, made PyPI publish failures block GitHub Releases unless
  `PYPI_SKIP=true`, and added an sdist `LICENSE` invariant.

- **`Learned: error recovery` section in MEMORY.md no longer bloats with
  stale, one-shot, or contradictory entries.** The matchers paired up
  unrelated tool calls (e.g. `state.rs` and `lib.rs` in the same dir
  becoming `File state.rs does not exist. The correct path is lib.rs.`),
  the dedup key was the literal rendered bullet text so near-duplicates
  each created their own row, the shutdown flush dropped the evidence
  gate to 1 so every singleton landed at session end, and there was no
  TTL or re-validation. Fixed at every layer:
  (1) **Emission**: Read recoveries require the failed/successful
  basenames to be identical or close in edit distance; Bash recoveries
  require a shared binary (allowing `python`↔`python3` and
  `ruff`↔`.venv/bin/ruff` variants) plus low-edit-distance OR a shared
  substantive non-flag token. Unrelated pairs are rejected at the source.
  (2) **Dedup**: error-recovery rows are hashed on recovery intent —
  Read on `(basename(error_path), basename(success_path))`, Bash on the
  primary command stripped of volatile suffixes (`| tail -N`, `2>&1`,
  etc.). Near-duplicates collapse into one row.
  (3) **Evidence gating**: default `min_evidence` raised from 2 to 5;
  shutdown-relaxation removed; new `--min-evidence` flag and
  `HEADROOM_MIN_EVIDENCE` envvar so embedded clients can tighten the
  threshold further.
  (4) **Render-time refinement**: drop rows not re-observed in 21 days,
  re-validate Read success paths against the filesystem, collapse
  same-error_path-with-multiple-targets into one "use Glob/Grep first"
  bullet, rank by `evidence_count * 0.5 ** (days/5)`, cap the section
  at 15. A→B / B→A contradiction pairs are also dropped at flush time.
  Patterns now stamp `first_seen_at` / `last_seen_at` on every save;
  `_bump_persisted_evidence` updates them via `json_set`. Other
  `Learned: …` categories (environment, preference, architecture) are
  untouched.
- **`headroom unwrap codex` now actually undoes `headroom wrap codex`** —
  previously there was no `unwrap codex` subcommand at all, so the injected
  `model_provider = "headroom"` / `[model_providers.headroom]` block stayed
  in `~/.codex/config.toml` forever and Codex continued routing through the
  (potentially stopped) proxy, surfacing as `Missing environment variable:
  OPENAI_API_KEY`. `wrap codex` now snapshots the pre-wrap
  `config.toml` to `config.toml.headroom-backup` before its first injection,
  and `unwrap codex` restores that snapshot byte-for-byte (or, if the
  backup is missing, strips only the Headroom-managed block and leaves
  surrounding user content intact). Safe no-op when run without a prior
  wrap. Reported by @raenaryl in Discord.
- **Image compressors now release shared router models after use and proxy shutdown** —
  the proxy/image compression path no longer keeps global `technique-router`
  and `SigLIP` model instances pinned in memory after one-off image
  optimization work. The `get_compressor()` helper now returns a fresh,
  caller-owned compressor instead of a process-lifetime singleton.
- **`headroom learn` no longer clobbers prior recommendations on re-run** —
  the marker block in `CLAUDE.md` / `MEMORY.md` is now merged with the
  prior block instead of wholesale-replaced. Sections re-surfaced by the
  new run win; sections not re-surfaced are carried forward so learnings
  accumulate across runs instead of disappearing. To fully rebuild the
  block, delete it manually and re-run. (#231)
- **`headroom learn` no longer emits dangling cross-references when a
  section is re-surfaced** — the analyzer now includes the project's
  current `<!-- headroom:learn -->` block (from `CLAUDE.md` and
  `MEMORY.md`) in the LLM digest as a "Prior Learned Patterns" section,
  and the system prompt instructs the LLM that re-emitting a section
  replaces the prior one wholesale. Prevents bullets like "`X` is *also*
  large — same rule as `Y`, `Z`" from appearing after `Y` and `Z` got
  dropped during per-section replacement. The writer's section-level
  carry-forward from #231 remains in place as a safety net for sections
  the LLM omits entirely. New helper `extract_marker_block` added to
  `headroom.learn.writer`.

### Added
- **`turn_id` linking agent-loop API calls to a single user prompt** — a new
  `compute_turn_id(model, system, messages)` helper in
  `headroom/proxy/helpers.py` hashes the message prefix up to and including
  the last user-text message, yielding an id that is stable across every
  agent-loop iteration of one prompt but rolls over when the user sends a
  new prompt (or runs `/compact`, `/clear`). `RequestLog` gained a
  `turn_id: str | None` field, which is stamped at every log site
  (anthropic handler bedrock + direct branches, and the streaming handler)
  and surfaced as `turn_id` in `/transformations/feed`. Lets downstream
  consumers (e.g. the Headroom Desktop Activity tab) aggregate savings per
  user prompt rather than per API call.
- **Live flush of traffic-learned patterns to CLAUDE.md / MEMORY.md** — the
  `TrafficLearner` now writes to agent-native context files continuously
  during proxy operation, not just at shutdown. A new dirty-flag debounced
  `_flush_worker` (10s window, `FLUSH_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS`) calls
  `flush_to_file()` whenever `_accumulate()` marks the learner dirty, so
  patterns surface in `CLAUDE.md` / `MEMORY.md` near real-time. Flushes
  read both persisted rows (via `_load_persisted_patterns_from_sqlite`)
  and the in-memory accumulator, bucket patterns by project via the learn
  plugin registry (`plugin.discover_projects()` + longest-path anchoring
  in `_project_for_pattern`), and route by `PatternCategory` to the
  correct file (`_patterns_to_recommendations` +
  `_CATEGORY_TO_TARGET`). Live flushes require `evidence_count >= 2`;
  the shutdown flush accepts single-evidence rows.

### Fixed
- **Traffic-learner evidence count stuck at 1; duplicate DB rows across
  restarts.** `_accumulate` queued patterns with the default
  `ExtractedPattern.evidence_count = 1` regardless of how many times the
  pattern was actually seen, so every persisted row landed at `1` and
  never crossed the live-flush gate (`evidence_count >= 2`). Worse, once
  a pattern was in `_saved_hashes` it was early-returned on every
  re-sighting, and `_saved_hashes` reset on process restart — so a second
  sighting in a later session inserted a duplicate row rather than
  bumping the existing one. Now: `_accumulate` writes the real
  accumulated count at save time, `start()` hydrates `_saved_hashes` +
  a new `_persisted_ids` map from the DB, and re-sightings bump the
  persisted row's `metadata.evidence_count` via an atomic `json_set`
  `UPDATE` (`_bump_persisted_evidence`). `_load_persisted_patterns_from_sqlite`
  now filters via `json_extract(metadata, '$.source')` instead of a
  LIKE on the raw JSON string, so rows survive metadata rewrites.

### Added
- **`HEADROOM_QDRANT_*` environment variables for memory Qdrant configuration**
  (#31) — `Memory(backend="qdrant-neo4j")`, `Mem0Config`, `MemoryConfig`, and
  `ProxyConfig` now resolve their Qdrant connection from
  `HEADROOM_QDRANT_URL`, `HEADROOM_QDRANT_HOST`, `HEADROOM_QDRANT_PORT`,
  `HEADROOM_QDRANT_API_KEY`, `HEADROOM_QDRANT_HTTPS`,
  `HEADROOM_QDRANT_PREFER_GRPC`, and `HEADROOM_QDRANT_GRPC_PORT`. Explicit
  constructor arguments still win; unset env keeps the existing
  `localhost:6333` defaults. Adds matching `--memory-qdrant-{url,host,port,api-key}`
  CLI flags. Enables hosted Qdrant (Qdrant Cloud) and shared/remote Qdrant
  stacks without code changes. New helper:
  [`headroom/memory/qdrant_env.py`](headroom/memory/qdrant_env.py).
- **Telemetry stack & install-mode identity fields** — anonymous beacon now
  reports `headroom_stack` (how Headroom is invoked: `proxy`, `wrap_claude`,
  `adapter_ts_openai`, ...) and `install_mode` (`wrapped` / `persistent` /
  `on_demand`), plus `requests_by_stack` for proxies that serve multiple
  integrations. Proxy exposes a `by_stack` bucket alongside `by_provider` /
  `by_model` on `/stats`, a matching `headroom_requests_by_stack` Prometheus
  counter, and an `X-Headroom-Stack` header honored by the FastAPI middleware.
  `headroom wrap <tool>` sets `HEADROOM_STACK=wrap_<agent>`; the TS SDK and
  all four adapters (`openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `vercel-ai`) tag their
  compress calls. Schema migration:
  [`sql/upgrade_telemetry_stack_context.sql`](sql/upgrade_telemetry_stack_context.sql).
- **Canonical filesystem contract** (issue #175) — new `HEADROOM_CONFIG_DIR`
  (default `~/.headroom/config`, read-mostly) and `HEADROOM_WORKSPACE_DIR`
  (default `~/.headroom`, read-write state) env vars recognized by the Python
  proxy/CLI and the npm SDK. Additive; all existing per-resource env vars
  (`HEADROOM_SAVINGS_PATH`, `HEADROOM_TOIN_PATH`,
  `HEADROOM_SUBSCRIPTION_STATE_PATH`, `HEADROOM_MODEL_LIMITS`) continue to
  work with identical semantics. Docker install scripts and
  `docker-compose.native.yml` forward the new vars into containers so
  savings, logs, and telemetry resolve to the bind-mounted `.headroom` path.
  See [`wiki/filesystem-contract.md`](wiki/filesystem-contract.md).

### Changed
- **`/stats-history` now returns compact checkpoint history by default** — the
  JSON response keeps recent checkpoints dense while evenly sampling older
  checkpoints so long-running installs do not return ever-growing payloads.
  Add `history_mode=full` to fetch the full retained checkpoint list, or
  `history_mode=none` to skip it entirely while still receiving the derived
  hourly/daily/weekly/monthly rollups. Responses now include a
  `history_summary` block describing stored versus returned points.

### Fixed
- **Streaming Anthropic requests are now visible to `/stats.recent_requests`
  and `/transformations/feed`** — `_finalize_stream_response` did not call
  `self.logger.log(...)`, so the entire streaming Anthropic code path (the
  one Claude Code uses) silently bypassed the request logger. Only the
  non-streaming Anthropic path and the Bedrock streaming path were logged.
  As a consequence, `--log-messages` had no observable effect on the live
  transformations feed for typical traffic. The streaming finalizer now
  emits the same `RequestLog` shape the other paths do, including
  `request_messages` when `log_full_messages` is enabled.

## [0.5.22] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Cross-agent memory** — Claude saves a fact, Codex reads it back. All agents sharing one proxy share one memory store. Project-scoped DB at `.headroom/memory.db`, auto user_id from `$USER`.
- **Agent provenance tracking** — every memory records which agent saved it (`source_agent`, `source_provider`, `created_via`), with edit history on updates.
- **LLM-mediated dedup** — on `memory_save`, enriched response hints similar existing memories to the LLM. Background async dedup auto-removes >92% cosine duplicates. Zero extra LLM calls.
- **Memory for OpenAI and Gemini handlers** — context injection + tool handling wired into all three provider handlers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini).
- **Plugin architecture for `headroom learn`** — each agent (Claude, Codex, Gemini) is a self-contained plugin. External plugins register via `headroom.learn_plugin` entry points. `--agent` flag for CLI.
- **GeminiScanner** for `headroom learn` — reads `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/session-*.json` and `.jsonl`.
- **Code graph integration** — `headroom wrap claude --code-graph` auto-indexes the project via [codebase-memory-mcp](https://github.com/DeusData/codebase-memory-mcp) for call-chain traversal, impact analysis, and architectural queries. Opt-in, ~200 token overhead with Claude Code's MCP Tool Search.
- **OpenAI embedder auto-detection** — memory backend uses OpenAI embeddings when `sentence-transformers` is unavailable (no torch/2GB dependency needed).
- **Live traffic learning flush** — `headroom wrap <agent> --learn` flushes learned patterns to the correct agent-native file (MEMORY.md / AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md) at proxy shutdown.

### Changed
- **CodeCompressor disabled by default** — AST-based code compression produced invalid syntax on 40% of real files. Code now passes through uncompressed. Use `--code-graph` for code intelligence instead, or re-enable with `--code-aware`.
- **Shared tool name map** — consolidated tool normalization across all learn plugins into `_shared.py`.
- **Dynamic CLI agent detection** — `headroom learn` discovers agents via plugin registry, no hardcoded choices.

### Fixed
- **CodeCompressor statement-based truncation** — body truncation now walks AST statements (not lines), never cuts mid-expression. Fixes syntax errors on multi-line dict literals and function calls.
- **Docstring FIRST_LINE mode** — uses source lines directly instead of reconstructing from byte offsets. Properly handles all quote styles.
- **Memory shutdown queue drain** — patterns in the save queue were lost on proxy shutdown. Now drained before exit.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Codex-proxy resilience hardening** — reduces event-loop starvation under cold-start reconnect storms
  - **Stage-timing instrumentation** — per-stage durations for both Codex WS accept and Anthropic `/v1/messages` pre-upstream phases emitted as a single `STAGE_TIMINGS` structured log line per request plus Prometheus histograms
  - **Per-pipeline shared warmup** — Anthropic + OpenAI pipelines eagerly load compressors/parsers once at startup; status merged into `WarmupRegistry` for `/debug/warmup` and `/readyz`
  - **WS session registry** — first-class tracking of active Codex WS sessions with deterministic relay-task cancellation and termination-cause classification (`client_disconnect`, `upstream_error`, `client_timeout`, etc.)
  - **Bounded pre-upstream Anthropic concurrency** — `--anthropic-pre-upstream-concurrency` / `HEADROOM_ANTHROPIC_PRE_UPSTREAM_CONCURRENCY` caps simultaneous `/v1/messages` pre-upstream work (body read, deep copy, first compression stage, memory-context lookup, upstream connect) so replay storms cannot starve `/livez`, `/readyz`, and new Codex WS opens. Default: auto `max(2, min(8, cpu_count))`; `0` or negative disables (unbounded)
  - **Loopback-only debug endpoints** — `/debug/tasks`, `/debug/ws-sessions`, `/debug/warmup` return `404` (not `403`) to non-loopback callers so external scanners cannot enumerate them
  - **Reconnect-storm repro harness** — `scripts/repro_codex_replay.py` drives concurrent WS + HTTP replay traffic against a local proxy and asserts `/livez` p99 under threshold; `--json` output routes JSON to stdout and the human summary to stderr
- **Proxy liveness and readiness health checks**
  - Adds `GET /livez` for process liveness and `GET /readyz` for traffic readiness
  - Keeps `GET /health` backward compatible while expanding it with readiness details and subsystem checks
  - Eagerly initializes configured memory backends during proxy startup so readiness reflects real serving capability
  - Wires `/readyz` into the Docker image `HEALTHCHECK` and the example `docker-compose.yml`
- **Durable proxy savings history**
  - Persists proxy compression savings history locally at `~/.headroom/proxy_savings.json`
  - Supports `HEADROOM_SAVINGS_PATH` to override the storage location
  - Adds `/stats-history` with lifetime totals plus hourly/daily/weekly/monthly rollups
  - Supports JSON and CSV export from `/stats-history`
  - Extends `/stats` with a `persistent_savings` block while keeping `savings_history` backward compatible
  - Adds a historical mode to `/dashboard` backed by `/stats-history`, including export actions
- **Proxy telemetry SDK override** via `HEADROOM_SDK`
  - Downstream apps can override the anonymous telemetry `sdk` field without patching installed files
  - Blank values fall back to the default `proxy` label
- **`headroom learn`** — Offline failure learning for coding agents
  - Analyzes past conversation history (Claude Code, extensible to Cursor/Codex)
  - **Success correlation**: for each failure, finds what succeeded after and extracts the specific correction
  - 5 analyzers: Environment, Structure, Command Patterns, Retry Prevention, Cross-Session
  - Writes specific learnings to CLAUDE.md (stable project facts) and MEMORY.md (session patterns)
  - Generic architecture: tool-agnostic `ToolCall` model, pluggable Scanner/Writer adapters
  - Dry-run by default, `--apply` to write, `--all` for all projects
  - Example output: "FirstClassEntity.java is not at axion-formats/ — actually at axion-scala-common/"
- **Read Lifecycle Management** — Event-driven compression of stale/superseded Read outputs
  - Detects when a Read output becomes stale (file was edited after) or superseded (file was re-read)
  - Replaces stale/superseded content with compact CCR markers, stores originals for retrieval
  - 75% of Read output bytes are provably stale or redundant (from real-world analysis of 66K tool calls)
  - Fresh Reads (latest read, no subsequent edit) are never touched — Edit safety preserved
  - Opt-in via `ReadLifecycleConfig(enabled=True)`, disabled by default
  - Handles both OpenAI and Anthropic message formats
- **any-llm backend** - Route requests through 38+ LLM providers (OpenAI, Mistral, Groq, Ollama, etc.) via [any-llm](https://mozilla-ai.github.io/any-llm/providers/)
  - Enable with `--backend anyllm --anyllm-provider <provider>`
  - Install with: `pip install 'headroom-ai[anyllm]'`
- Production-ready proxy server with caching, rate limiting, and metrics
- CLI command `headroom proxy` to start the proxy server
- **IntelligentContextManager** (semantic-aware context management)
  - Multi-factor importance scoring: recency, semantic similarity, TOIN importance, error indicators, forward references, token density
  - No hardcoded patterns - all importance signals learned from TOIN or computed from metrics
  - TOIN integration for retrieval_rate and field_semantics-based scoring
  - Strategy selection: NONE, COMPRESS_FIRST, DROP_BY_SCORE based on budget overage
  - Atomic tool unit handling (call + response dropped together)
  - Configurable scoring weights via `ScoringWeights` dataclass
  - `IntelligentContextConfig` for full configuration control
  - Backwards compatible with `RollingWindowConfig`
- **LLMLingua-2 Integration** (opt-in ML-based compression)
  - `LLMLinguaCompressor` transform using Microsoft's LLMLingua-2 model
  - Content-aware compression rates (code: 0.4, JSON: 0.35, text: 0.3)
  - Memory management utilities: `unload_llmlingua_model()`, `is_llmlingua_model_loaded()`
  - Proxy integration via `--llmlingua` flag
  - Device selection: `--llmlingua-device` (auto/cuda/cpu/mps)
  - Custom compression rate: `--llmlingua-rate`
  - Helpful startup hints when llmlingua is available but not enabled
  - Install with: `pip install headroom-ai[llmlingua]`
- **Code-Aware Compression** (AST-based, syntax-preserving)
  - `CodeAwareCompressor` transform using tree-sitter for AST parsing
  - Supports Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C, C++
  - Preserves imports, function signatures, type annotations, error handlers
  - Compresses function bodies while maintaining structural integrity
  - Guarantees syntactically valid output (no broken code)
  - Automatic language detection from code patterns
  - Memory management: `is_tree_sitter_available()`, `unload_tree_sitter()`
  - Uses `tree-sitter-language-pack` for broad language support
  - Install with: `pip install headroom-ai[code]`
- **ContentRouter** (intelligent compression orchestrator)
  - Auto-routes content to optimal compressor based on type detection
  - Source hint support for high-confidence routing (file paths, tool names)
  - Handles mixed content (e.g., markdown with code blocks)
  - Strategies: CODE_AWARE, SMART_CRUSHER, SEARCH, LOG, TEXT, LLMLINGUA
  - Configurable strategy preferences and fallbacks
  - Routing decision log for transparency and debugging
- **Custom Model Configuration**
  - Support for new models: Claude 4.5 (Opus), Claude 4 (Sonnet, Haiku), o3, o3-mini
  - Pattern-based inference for unknown models (opus/sonnet/haiku tiers)
  - Custom model config via `HEADROOM_MODEL_LIMITS` environment variable
  - Config file support: `~/.headroom/models.json`
  - Graceful fallback for unknown models (no crashes)
  - Updated pricing data for all current models

### Fixed
- **Event.wait task leak in subscription trackers** — `asyncio.shield` pattern prevents cancellation of the outer `wait_for` from leaking the inner `Event.wait` task
- **Python 3.10 compatibility for memory-context fail-open** — catches `asyncio.TimeoutError` (the 3.10-compatible alias) rather than `TimeoutError` to preserve behaviour on older runtimes
- **uvicorn `proxy_headers=False`** — refuses `Forwarded` / `X-Forwarded-For` rewrites so the loopback guard on `/debug/*` cannot be spoofed by a misconfigured reverse proxy
- **First-frame timeout for Codex WS accepts** — guards against a client that opens a handshake and never sends the first frame; relays cancel deterministically with `client_timeout`
- **Semaphore leak on unexpected exception in Anthropic pre-upstream path** — the finalizer now releases the pre-upstream semaphore on every exit path (early 4xx, cache hit, upstream error, streaming handoff)
- **`active_relay_tasks` gauge double-decrement** — `deregister_and_count` returns `(handle, released_task_count)` atomically so the handler decrements the Prometheus gauge by the exact number it registered, eliminating drift

### Internal
- **IPv6-mapped loopback recognition** — the loopback guard parses `::ffff:127.0.0.1` and other dual-stack literals through `ipaddress.ip_address(...).is_loopback`
- **Lock-free stage-timing accumulators** — `record_stage_timings` writes to per-path counters that do not contend with `/metrics` export or `record_request`
- **Narrow `contextlib.suppress` in relay classification** — only `CancelledError` is suppressed where we reclassify it; other exceptions propagate so termination cause stays truthful
- **`jitter_delay_ms` helper** — shared exponential-backoff + 50-150% jitter formula in `headroom/proxy/helpers.py`; used by three proxy retry sites and mirrored inline in the repro harness

## Migration Guide

### From 0.1.x to 0.2.x

The 0.2.0 release is backward compatible. New features are opt-in:

```python
# Old code still works
from headroom import HeadroomClient, OpenAIProvider

# New SmartCrusher (replaces ToolCrusher for better compression)
from headroom import SmartCrusher, SmartCrusherConfig

config = SmartCrusherConfig(
    min_tokens_to_crush=200,
    max_items_after_crush=50,
)
crusher = SmartCrusher(config)

# New relevance scoring
from headroom import create_scorer

scorer = create_scorer("hybrid")  # or "bm25" for zero deps
```

### Using the Proxy

New in 0.2.0 - run Headroom as a proxy server:

```bash
# Start the proxy
python -m headroom.proxy.server --port 8787

# Use with Claude Code
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8787 claude
```
